The program I will make is a mathematical figure area calculator. There are three shapes, a square, and a circle. Each figure has a different way of calculating its area. A triangle is divided into two by multiplying its base by its height. A square obtains its side area. The circle is calculated by the radius. The program asks the user what shape the area of the figure you are looking for, and then uses the area formula to find the value according to the figure you entered. In my program, I will use multiplication and division calculations. I will set the equation for calculating the area of each figure using 'double' and use 'switch' to calculate the area of each figure. Using the switch or if/else statement function, at the end, I will ask the user to evaluate my program from 1 to 5. After that, I will ask the user if he wants to do other calculations using 'bool', and then I will create an iterative program. I will save the values that the user entered, arrange them, and finally show the results that the user entered when he wanted to stop the program.

I focused on using the functions I learned in class, I put all the functions into the program.
